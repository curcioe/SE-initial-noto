# SE-initial-noto
MATLAB files which generate initial geometry .txt files of model notochords for Surface Evolver

Two files:
1) generalized_bamboo_curcio
2) staircasecode_20220220

The first creates the initial geometry of a model notochord in bamboo configuration as a .txt file to be read into Surface Evolver
The second creates the initial geometry of a model notochord in staircase configuration as a .txt file to be read into Surface Evolver

These are described in more detail in Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and the Appendix of my dissertation:

Chapter 2 was published in *Cells & Development*, found here:
